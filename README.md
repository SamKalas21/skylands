# skylands  
### Welcome to the skylands!  
The skylands is a brand-new dimension of floating islands for you to explore.  The dimension is reminiscent of the end and the overworld with a little twist thrown in.  The intention of this datapack is to create an original experience with mid- to end-game content.  The datapack is in very early development and currently features 3 new biomes and one vanilla biome.  
## Accessing the dimension  
 - Install the Skylands data pack by putting it in your world's data pack folder during creation (works in 1.16.5)  
 - This folder can be accessed in the world creation menu  
 - The data pack does not require a resource pack yet  
 - Reaching y = 200 in any dimension will cause the player to teleport to the skylands  
 - Alternatively, type /execute in skylands:sky run tp @s ~ ~ ~  (note: be prepared to fly immediately or risk falling back into the overworld)  
## Biomes  
#### Note: all custom biomes have a blue/purple color palette that affects grass, leaves, water, and the sky.  Also, none of the custom biomes have lava lakes.  
 - Sky Plains  
   - The sky variant of the overworld plains biome  
   - The most common sky biome  
   - Has berry bushes  
   - Has sparse trees  
 - Sky Forest  
   - The sky variant of the overworld forest biome  
   - The second most common sky biome  
   - Has mostly custom trees and a few vanilla trees  
 - Sky Jungle  
   - The sky variant of the overworld jungle biome  
   - the rarest sky biome  
   - Currently only has bushes but will have tall custom jungle trees  
   - The Sky Jungle looks best with max biome blend settings  
 - Mushroom Fields  
   - The vanilla Mushroom Fields biome  
## Upcoming Features  
 - Custom Crafting table and recipes  
 - Custom weapons and abilities 
 - Custom tools 
 - Custom mobs and bosses  
 - Custom Structures  
 - Lore  
## Known Bugs  
 - Mineshafts spawn underneath the islands in mushroom biomes  
 - Reaching y = 200 in the skylands teleports the player to the skylands; this is redundant
